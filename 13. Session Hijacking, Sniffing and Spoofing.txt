                                                        Session hijacking, Sniffing and Spoofing
                                                             
What is session -
- After Validating user with on basis of username and password, server assign him a string value called **Session ID**
- These Session ID's are used to identify USERs.
- After Validating user's credentials a fresh Session ID is assigned to User Every time.
- This Session ID is Stored in Form of Cookies on User's Browser.

What is cookies -
- Cookies are the values which help server to validate requests for each user or session
- Cookies Contain User Identity Details, Personalization, and other information used to identify user and computer on network.

Why session hijacking works -
-> Insecure Session Handling
-> Insecure Session Termination
-> Weak Session ID generation algorithms - linear algo. used such as time or IP address for generating session ID.
-> Unencrypted Session ID's

Types of session hijacking -
- Active - In Active Session Hijacking, Attacker steal Session Cookies from victim's Browser and use those cookies. Also known Application-Level Hijacking.
- Passive - A passive Attack uses sniffers on the network, allowing attacker to obtain info. to log on as a valid user and enjoy the privileges.
Also called Network-Level Hijacking.

Methods to obtain session id -
- Predict Session
- MITM = Man In The Middle Attack
- MITB = Man In The Browser Attack => Hijack Victims Browser - BeEF
- Network Sniffing
- Malware Attack
- XSS = Cross-Site Scripting => Executing Malicious Script to fetch User Cookies, when Victim Browse a Website script executes and Attacker get Session ID.
- Proxy Server => Attacker use their System as a Proxy Server for Victim so that all the traffic pass through their machine, and they can extract juicy info
from requests and responses.

We will use cookie editor extension for practical part.

                                                         Sniffing and spoofing


Linux :
We will use wireshark for sniffing in linux.
ip.src == ip address - for source side
ip.addr == ip address - for anywhere
ip.dst == ip address - for destination side
!= - for not equal too

Mac Spoofing in linux :
MAC Address spoofing in linux
Use command #ifconfig for checking your own mac address.
Check in ether line for our own mac address and check the network interface.
After that down that interface with the command #ifconfig eth0(interface name) down.
Now use command #ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 and type the new mac address you want to use.
Now use command #ifconfig and you will see your mac address is changed.

Spoofing in linux :
We will use some mac address changer tool in kali.
