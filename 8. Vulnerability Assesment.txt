                                                                Vulnerability Assesment

Vulnerability analysis is a part of the scanning phase. In the Hacking cycle.
vulnerability analysis is a major and important part. In this module, we will discuss the concept
of vulnerability assessment, Vulnerability Assessment phases, types of assessment, tools and other important aspects.

This is a fundamental task for a penetration tester to discover the vulnerabilities in an environment.
Vulnerability assessment includes discovering weakness is an environment, design flaws and other security concerns which can cause an operating system, application or website to be misused.
Basically, In vulnerability assessment we will check Vulnerability Impact and Vulnerability Ranking


What type of vulnerabilities included :

	- Misconfiguration
	- Default Configuration
	- Design flaws
	- Buffer Overflow
	- Operating System Flaws
	- SQL Injection
	- XSS Attack etc.

Vulnerability Divides in Four categories

	1) Low
	2) Medium
	3) High
	4) Critical

Types of Vulnerability Assessment

	• Active Assessment - Direct interaction
	• Passive assessment - Indirect Interaction
	• External Assessment - Outside Org
	• Internal Assessment - Inside Org
	• Host Based Assessment - On a Pc
	• Network Assessment - On a Network
	• Application Assessment - Web, Mobile etc.
	• Wireless Network Assessment - WIFI

Vulnerability Management Life Cycle

	1) Creating Baseline
	2) Vulnerability Assessment
	3) Risk Assessment
	4) Remediation
	5) Verification
	6) Monitor

Vulnerability Scoring Systems

1: Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
      Security Base Score Rating
      None		0.0
      Low		0.1 - 3.9
      Medium		4.0 - 6.9
      High		7.0 - 8.9
      Critical	        9.0 - 10.0
